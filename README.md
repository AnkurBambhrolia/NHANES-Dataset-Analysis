# NHANES-Dataset-Analysis
## Project Overview 
This paper looks into  relationship between regular marijuana usage and its potential influence on a sedentary lifestyle using the NHANES dataset. The analysis explores whether individuals who report regularly using marijuana are more likely to exhibit sedentary lifestyle indicators—specifically elevated BMI, higher resting heart rate, and reduced physical activity—compared to those who do not. All data is sourced from the NHANES R package and incorporates data cleaning, data visualization, parametric and non-parametric testing. All code was sourced in R and RMarkdown and is free to use.
